The purpose of this project is to develop and apply a method for the non-destructive measurement of aromatic compounds in medicinal plant species using Near Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy. Aromatic compounds, such as phenolics, terpenoids, and flavonoids, are known for their therapeutic properties, making them critical components of medicinal plants. Traditional methods of quantifying these compounds, such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), are time-consuming, expensive, and require extensive sample preparation. In contrast, NIR spectroscopy offers a rapid, cost-effective, and non-destructive alternative for identifying and quantifying these bioactive compounds.
